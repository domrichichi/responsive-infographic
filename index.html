  <h1>The Future of Fitness 2015</h1>

  <h2>Section 1 Title: Current State of the Fitness-Tech Industry</h2>

  <p>Consumers increasingly turn to their smartphones and activity trackers when looking to improve their health and fitness</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="" alt="smart phone">
    <figcaption>Almost one-third of US smartphone users use fitness tracking apps</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure>
    <img src="" alt="nike fuel band">
    <figcaption>15% of consumers currently use wearable tech, such as smartwatches and fitness bands, in their daily lives. Wearable technology is expected to reach an adoption rate of 28% by 2016</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure>
    <img src="" alt="nike fuel band">
    <figcaption>61% of all devices in the wearable tech market are used for tracking fitness activities. The top activities include tracking mileage and calories</figcaption>
  </figure>

	<p>While consumer fitness tracking products are on the rise, the fitness industry has been slow to adopt a solution for the in-gym experience</p>

	<h2>Section 2 Title: Three Areas of Opportunities for Connected Gyms</h2>

	<div class="media">
		<img class="media__img" src="" alt="Area 1">
		<p class="media__body">1.	Motivated members lead to higher retention</p>
	</div>

	<figure>
		<img src="" alt="">
		<figcaption>52% of owners use their wearable fitness devices to stay motivated</figcaption>
	</figure>


	<div class="media">
		<img class="media__img" src="" alt="Area 2">
		<p class="media__body">2.	Virtual Personal Training creates a new revenue stream for gyms</p>
	</div>

  <p>Personal training is inaccessible to many members at an average costs of $56 per session</p>

		<p class="media__body">3.	Gym analytics provide new insights into what equipment members need the most</p>
	</div>

    <figcaption>One of the biggest expenses for fitness facilities is buying and maintaining equipment, accounting for about 7.4% of revenue</figcaption>
  </figure>

	<h2>Section 3 Title: What’s Holding Back Connected Gyms</h2>

	<p>The variety of exercises that can be performed in the gym mean that there is no one-size-fits-all sensor for tracking everything. Rather, there needs to be a suite of sensors for different equipment and exercises, and a way to connect all the systems</p>

	<h2>Section 4 Title: Why the Internet of Things (IoT) Will Change the Fitness Industry</h2>

	As of 2008, there are now more “things or objects” connected to the Internet than people. Already, companies across industries are seeing positive returns on their IoT investments, however, the fitness industry has yet to fully capitalize on the increased opportunity8

	By 2020, the amount of Internet-connected things will reach 50 billion, with $19 trillion in profits and cost savings coming from IoT over the next decade9
