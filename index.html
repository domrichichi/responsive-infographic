	</div>

	<p>Only 13.5% of gym members are signed up for personal training services, and the majority drop their trainer after 3-4 sessions</p>

	</div>

	<h2>Section 3 Title: What’s Holding Back Connected Gyms</h2>

	The variety of exercises that can be performed in the gym mean that there is no one-size-fits-all sensor for tracking everything. Rather, there needs to be a suite of sensors for different equipment and exercises, and a way to connect all the systems

	<h2>Section 4 Title: Why the Internet of Things (IoT) Will Change the Fitness Industry</h2>

	As of 2008, there are now more “things or objects” connected to the Internet than people. Already, companies across industries are seeing positive returns on their IoT investments, however, the fitness industry has yet to fully capitalize on the increased opportunity8

	By 2020, the amount of Internet-connected things will reach 50 billion, with $19 trillion in profits and cost savings coming from IoT over the next decade9
